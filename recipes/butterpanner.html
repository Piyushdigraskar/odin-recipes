    <h2>Butter panner recipe</h2>
    <p>To make paneer butter, heat butter in a pan and saut√© onions, tomatoes, garlic, and ginger until softened, then blend into a smooth paste. Add the paste back to the pan, mix in spices like turmeric, cumin, garam masala, and chili powder, and let it cook with a splash of cream for a rich, creamy sauce. Finally, add paneer cubes and simmer until they absorb the flavors, then garnish with fresh coriander and serve warm with naan or rice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
