    <h2>Samosa recipe</h2>
    <p>To make samosas, prepare a spiced filling by cooking potatoes, peas, and aromatics like cumin, ginger, and garam masala until soft and fragrant. Make a dough with flour, water, and oil, then roll it out, cut into semi-circles, and shape into cones. Fill each cone with the potato mixture, seal the edges, and fry until golden and crispy, then serve with chutney for dipping.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 quarts all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>4 quarts oil for deep frying</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 small onions, chopped</li>
        <li>8 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>8 green chile peppers, chopped</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons fresh ginger root, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
        <li>3 pounds ground lamb</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>8 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix flour, salt, and butter until the mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. Pour in water, using more (up to approximately 1/4 cup) if necessary to make a smooth dough. Pat into a ball. Place on a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic. Return to the bowl, cover, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large, deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in onion, garlic, green chile peppers, and ginger. Cook for 5 minutes, or until onions are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Stir in turmeric, chili powder, ground lamb, and salt. Cook until the lamb meat is evenly brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in garam masala and lemon juice. Continue cooking for 5 minutes, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 15 equal portions. Roll portions into balls, then flatten into 4-inch circles. Cut each circle in half. Dampen edges and form semicircles into cones.</li>
        <li>Fill cones with equal portions of the lamb meat mixture. Dampen top and bottom edges of cones, and pinch to seal.</li>
        <li>Carefully lower cones into preheated oil a few at a time. Fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve warm.</li>
      </ol>
